Sample REST client based on http://blog.springsource.org/2009/03/27/rest-in-spring-3-resttemplate/

Updated for release 3.1 of Spring.

To build and run:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.springsource.samples.resttemplate.Driver" -Dexec.args="[your key here] penguin"


What I had figured out to build & run before I read the comments on the blog post:

mvn compile
mvn jar:jar

(Probably could reduce that to one step by putting the jar:jar task into an appropriate lifecycle step in the POM file.)

ln -s <your-maven-repository-path> target/lib
java -jar target/resttemplate-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  your-flickr-api-key tags,to,search,for
